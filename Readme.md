# Prototype - Post Inspection Analytics Tool 

The Project is about building a protoype of Post-Inspection Analysis. The tech stack used for this project is Python as programming language, Pyside2 library for GUI Application and MongoDb for database.

## Dataset Creation
1. Created a Image dataset of 100 Images with 90% of Good Product Images and 10% of Bad Product Images. The 'Item1' Folder contains Dataset Images. 

2. To create dataset, made an automated dataset generator code named 'create_dataset_code.py'. Used sample 5-6 good status images and 3-4 bad status images example to create dataset of 100 images with 90% good status images and 10% bad status images.

## MongoDb Installation, Setup and Insertion
1. For storing information about the inspection 'MongoDB' database is used. MongoDB Database is installed from "https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community". After installation, add MongoDb to Path Variable(Important for url based connection using python)

2. For Connection and access of MongoDB database with Python install 'PyMongo' library. From PyMongo, MongoClient method was used for setting up connection with database using hostname and port_number. By default hostname = 'localhost' and port number = 27017.

3. First we inserted the static data to database named 'Inspection' and table named 'Company1'. The code to insert the data can found in mongo_db_insert.py. The table has 4 columns _id(Unique Id generated by MongoDB), SKU ID(Unique Product ID), Unit_Id, and Status. For this project we have only one SKU ID named 'Item1' and has 100 units named from 1 to 100.

4. Created 'db_query.py' named module to query particular data from database. Necessary methods are created to retrieve data from database like count of total entries, number of rows of particular group of status, and status of particular unit_id.

## GUI Application
1. For making GUI Application PySide2 library is used. To build application libraries installed are:
     i. PySide2 version = 5.15.2
    ii. PyQt5 = 5.15.2
   iii. PyQtChart = 5.15.2

2. In the GUI Application we have two features:
    i. Analytics Tab: Pie Chart View of Inspection data 
   ii. Image Gallery Tab: All the Product images are displayd with filter option

3. For Chart View different module is ceated named 'GraphView.py'. It is imported in 'main_gui.py' to view Pie Chart in Analytics Page.

4. To open the Application, run 'main_gui.py' file.

5. To view Charts and Images according to database 'db_query' module is imported in 'main_gui.py'.
6. To run the code in your system, before running 'main_gui.py' run th mongo_db_insert.py to insert the data in database.
7. Make sure while running the 'main_gui.py' db_query.py and GraphView.py is placed in same folder and the dataset folder is named 'Item1'
